## Learn Python

This is a collection of simple programming lessons in Python.

While you can of course read these files with any text editor you like, 
I would suggest opening them in PyCharm (In fact, in the first lesson I 
mention a couple of PyCharm shortcuts).
 
Inside of PyCharm, you can set a breakpoint on the first line of code by
double clicking on the line number, and then debug the program, stepping
through one line of code at a time, in order to observe the changes that
go on as the program runs.

This is a work in progress, so any feedback or suggestions are
appreciated.
